# Introduction

Welcome to Matthew Pechen-Berg's Plants vs. Zombies!


The goal of the game is to place down plants on your lawn to defend against an infinite number of waves of zombies.
In order to do this, you control a resource called 'sun' thatyou must produce from sunflowers or receive randomly from the sky.
The game ends when a zombie hits the left side of the screen.
You can also use the shovel tool to dig up plants you no longer want.
But first, you must create your arsenal of plants.
